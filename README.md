# Welcome to curiousCat's readme!

curiousCat is a web application for asking and answering questions. It was inspired by Quora and built using Javascript, React.js, Redux and Express.

# Installation

Clone the assessment repository from https://github.com/hauck29/soloProject-1.git

Rename the folder to whatever you want.

`cd` into the `backend` folder and `npm install` to install node package manager dependencies.
`cd` into the `frontend` folder and `npm install` to install node package manager dependencies.

# Running Locally
To start the server, run `npm start` from both the `frontend` and `backend` directories. This will allow you to make requests to http://localhost:3000 using any client (browser and Postman).
To stop the server from listening to requests, press CTRL + c for Windows/Linux or CMD + c for MacOS in the terminal that you started the server (wherever you ran npm start).

# Technical Details
This project was done during the week of November 8th - 14th, 2021.
curiousCat displays questions and answers (on the same card) that users can ask and answer at their leisure.

During compilation of this project, I required assistance with my backend routes to add and edit questions.
I estimate that I personally completed 95% of this project, receiving assistance for the last 5%.

I would like to extend a warm thank you to Ryan Maloney, Bill Adams, Ash Tucker and Alfredo Sugowara!
The discussions we had to clear concepts were enlightening and pivotal.
